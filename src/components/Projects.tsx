    description: `The name is probably self-explanatory to most people. Snuber is a social media and delivery service aimed at the average snus connoisseur. The idea came about when I was playing video games with my friends and one person called out in a panic that they were out of snus. "It would be so nice if all I'd to do was push a button and someone would deliver it to me!" That's basically the idea behind Snuber. It's a React Native app that lets you send snus distress calls to friends or people near you. When someone delivers snus, they are rewarded with points in the app. Unfortunately, I can't publish it due to tobacco regulations ðŸ”ž.`,

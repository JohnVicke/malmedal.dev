## Astro Content Collections

Astro Content Collections are a powerful way to manage static content in your applications.
Content collections live inside Astro's reserved `src/content` directory and generates metadata for your collections in the `.astro` directory.

<AstroCollectionTree />


Astro has excellent documentation, if you want to dive deeper into the framework and especially Content Collections 
I recommend you to check out the [official documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/).

## Xata serverless Postgres ❤️ Astro
As you might have noticed, every blog post keeps track of the number of times someone has visited the post. In order to persist the data I decided to try out [Xata](https://xata.io/). Xata is a serverless database platform for Postgres and has excellent integration with Astro. To get up and running, start by installing Xata and logging in:

<Steps>
```bash
npm install -g @xata.io/cli
```
```bash
xata auth login
```
</Steps>

Xata has a more extensive getting started guide.

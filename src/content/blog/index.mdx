## Hello there!

Just wanted to drop a quick hello ðŸ‘‹ as I kick off this blog. I'm all about diving headfirst into things that fascinate me, and I'm stoked to start sharing my thoughts right here.

You can expect developer workflow tips, tech reviews, what I'm currently building and whatever cool stuff I'm currently interested in.

## Behind the scenes

This blog? I wanted to create a minimal shell that is easy to maintain, update, and add new content to!

- **Built** using [Astro](https://astro.build/).
- **Styled** with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
- **Hosted** on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
- **Static** content with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).
- **Open** sourced on [Github](https://github.com/johnvicke/malmedal.dev).
- **Database** with [Xata](https://xata.io/)

## Next up

For my next post I'll go more in depth on how I have setup the blog and projects section of this site using [Astro Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/).

```js 
const posts = await getCollection("blog");
```

Catch you on the flip side!

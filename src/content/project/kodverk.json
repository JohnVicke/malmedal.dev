  "description": "I founded Kodverk together with my friend to simplify API integration and provide a user-friendly, type-safe solution. We noticed the lack of such tools during our university studies and wanted to empower developers to focus on their projects without the complexities of data retrieval. Kodverk offers clear documentation, SDKs, and supports hackathon enthusiasts, indie developers, startups, and students in various disciplines",

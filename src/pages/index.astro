     I’m a fullstack engineer specialized in web development, regularly
    exploring the latest frameworks to build seamless digital solutions. My
    journey has been diverse, having worked with large corporations like Cygni
    and Schibsted and agile startups like Coeo. This varied experience has
    broadened my knowledge, enabling me to adapt and thrive in any environment.<br
    /><br />
     When I'm not coding you'll find me embracing an active lifestyle as a
    competitive powerlifter, struggling disc golfer, retired action sports
    enthusiast and avid gamer.
